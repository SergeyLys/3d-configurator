# POC: tombstone simulator
A POC to demo use of three.js, react and react-three-renderer

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).


A live demo is at: http://shalosh.herokuapp.com/

## Warning

**This was a quick hack without proper linting or testing**

## Contributing

I'd love if this POC will turn to a demo of how to use React with Three.js and react-three-renderer.
